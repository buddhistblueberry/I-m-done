/**
 * Thread-safe persistent store for [WatchProgress] records.
 *
 * Backed by a single SharedPreferences file (`watch_progress`) that holds one
 * JSON string (`items`) — a serialized list of every watch-progress record.
 * Gson (already on the classpath via the Retrofit converter) handles the
 * (de)serialization.
 *
 * All public methods are safe to call from any thread: a ReentrantReadWriteLock
 * guards the in-memory cache, and SharedPreferences commits are synchronous
 * (`commit()`) so a process death mid-write never loses the final flush from
 * the player Activity's onDestroy.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   WatchProgressStore.init(context)          // once at app start
 *   WatchProgressStore.upsert(progress)       // while playing
 *   WatchProgressStore.markCompleted(key)     // on STATE_ENDED
 *   WatchProgressStore.activeItems()          // continue-watching row
 *   WatchProgressStore.allWatchedIds()        // for recommendations (exclude)
