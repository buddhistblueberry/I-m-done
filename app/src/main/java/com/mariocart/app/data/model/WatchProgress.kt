/**
 * Persistent record of how far the user has watched a title.
 *
 * Stored by [com.mariocart.app.data.repository.WatchProgressStore] in
 * SharedPreferences as a JSON list, keyed by `tmdbId + contentType + season +
 * episode` (so each episode of a TV show is tracked independently, just like
 * Netflix's "Continue Watching" row).
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *  - Created/updated every few seconds while a title plays (position grows).
 *  - Updated one last time when the player Activity is destroyed (final flush).
 *  - Flipped to `completed = true` when ExoPlayer reports STATE_ENDED. A
 *    completed record is the signal that removes the title from "Continue
 *    Watching" — the user finished it, so it no longer belongs in the row.
