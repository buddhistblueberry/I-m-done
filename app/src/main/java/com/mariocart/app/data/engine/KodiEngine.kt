/**
 * KodiEngine \u2014 the user's "Kodi-like engine running in the background".
 *
 * This is a headless, **no-WebView, no-Kodi-runtime** engine that runs the
 * `plugin.video.lookmovietomb` addon flow (search \u2192 storage \u2192 security
 * API \u2192 `.m3u8`) in a background coroutine scope. It is started by
 * [KodiEngineService] (a foreground Service) and lives for the lifetime of the
 * app process, so it can:
 *
 *  \u2022 **resolve on demand** \u2014 when PlayerActivity asks for a stream, the
 *    engine returns a cached one instantly (if fresh) or kicks off a fresh
 *    resolve in the background and delivers the result.
 *  \u2022 **pre-resolve** \u2014 browse/home screens can ask the engine to warm up
 *    the next likely title so playback starts instantly when the user hits
 *    play. This is the "Kodi addon running in the background" behaviour: it is
 *    always working ahead of the user.
 *  \u2022 **cache** \u2014 resolved streams go into [StreamCache] (memory + disk) so
 *    a replay or a quick back-and-forth never re-hits the network.
 *
 * The actual extraction is delegated to the existing, proven
 * [LookMovieHeadlessExtractor] \u2014 a pure-OkHttp port of the addon \u2014 so we do
 * NOT duplicate the addon logic or introduce a WebView. The engine is the
 * *orchestration* layer; the extractor is the *addon* layer. Other addon
 * flows can be plugged in later by implementing the [Addon] interface.
 *
 * ## Concurrency
 * Resolves are de-duplicated: if two callers ask for the same title at once,
 * only one network resolve runs and both observe the result. Pre-resolve
 * jobs are best-effort and never block an on-demand resolve.
