/**
 * StreamProviders — central access point for the **auto-updating** list of
 * embed stream providers.
 *
 * The actual provider roster lives in `working-servers.json` (the remote
 * auto-update source) and is fetched by [RemoteServerListFetcher] with a
 * three-tier fallback (remote → disk cache → bundled asset). This object is a
 * thin in-memory cache on top of that fetcher so callers don't repeatedly hit
 * disk/network.
 *
 * Each provider is a [ServerConfig] carrying its own URL **templates**, so new
 * providers can be added to the remote JSON (and pushed to the `main` branch)
 * without an app update — every install picks them up on the next launch.
 *
 * Ordering / health tracking / user-selected-server lives in [ServerManager];
 * this object only loads and caches the raw list.
