/**
 * StreamAvailabilityCache — a persistent, per-title record of which streaming
 * PROVIDERS actually work for a given movie or show.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 * The app races many providers (VidStorm, VidSrc, VidLink, VixSrc, NoTorrent,
 * + the embed servers) in parallel and lets ExoPlayer be the final arbiter of
 * playability. That guarantees EVERY resolvable title eventually plays, but it
 * also means the *first* attempt for a brand-new title may hand ExoPlayer a
 * dead URL (e.g. VidStorm's dead "Boron" worker for Interstellar) before
 * falling through to the provider that actually works (NoTorrent). That costs
 * the user ~4–8 s of "that source didn't play — trying another".
 *
 * This cache breaks that cold-start penalty: every time a provider successfully
 * plays a title we record it; every time ExoPlayer rejects a provider's URL for
 * a title we record that too. The next time the user opens the SAME title, the
 * player consults [knownGoodProvider] and leads with the provider that worked
 * before, and [knownBadProviders] lets the race skip providers we already know
 * are dead for this title — so playback starts on the first try.
 *
 * ## Key
 * The key is `tmdbId|contentType|season|episode` (season/episode are 0 for
 * movies). This granularity means a provider that works for S01E01 but not
 * S02E05 is tracked correctly per episode.
 *
 * ## Persistence
 * Records are stored as a single JSON file in the app's cache dir
 * (`stream_availability.json`). It is loaded lazily on first access and
 * rewritten (debounced via the mutex) on every update. A timestamp is kept per
 * entry so stale records (provider fixed a dead URL, or broke a working one)
 * eventually age out — a bad record older than [STALE_AFTER_MS] is ignored and
 * re-evaluated, and a good record is trusted up to [GOOD_TRUST_MS].
 *
 * ## Thread-safety
 * All mutations go through [saveMutex]; the in-memory map is a
 * `ConcurrentHashMap`-style guarded by the same mutex for simplicity.

     * excluded a working server (e.g. VidStorm·Lithium) for the rest of the
