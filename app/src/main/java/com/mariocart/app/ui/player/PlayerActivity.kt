/**
 * PlayerActivity — the on-device video player.
 *
 * This is the single activity that actually plays videos. It owns a fully
 * on-device extraction pipeline (no backend server involved):
 *
 *   0. [VidStormExtractor] (PRIMARY) — calls the VidStorm streaming API
 *      (vidstorm.ru/api), the same backend FilmCave's "cloud / servers"
 *      button uses, and resolves a **direct** `.m3u8` / `.mp4` URL for the
 *      given TMDB id in a single HTTP call — no WebView, no embed scraping,
 *      no Cloudflare challenge. This is by far the most reliable stage and
 *      is the root-cause fix for "only The Rookie played": virtually every
 *      other title fell through the fragile WebView stages below because
 *      LookMovie is Cloudflare-blocked and embed players don't always
 *      auto-request their media inside the extraction timeout, whereas the
 *      VidStorm API returns a real direct URL for almost everything.
 *   1. [VidSrcExtractor] (FALLBACK after VidStorm) — when VidStorm is broken
 *      for a title (Interstellar, The Green Mile, … get only a dead "Boron"
 *      URL), this walks the VidSrc embed pipeline
 *      (vidsrc.me → cloudorchestranova.com RCP/PRORCP → master_urls →
 *      generate.php token) over plain OkHttp and resolves live `#EXTM3U`
 *      manifests at 360p/720p/1080p. No WebView, no JS challenge. This is
 *      the "hidden servers in the exoplayer" aggregator sites keep behind
 *      their RCP indirection, and it consistently plays the titles VidStorm
 *      cannot. Fixes the long-wait-then-black-screen bug.
 *   2. [EmbedExtractor] (FALLBACK) — tries every embed provider
 *      (VidLink, 2Embed, VidSrc, …) inside an off-screen WebView and
 *      captures the direct `.m3u8`/`.mp4` URL the provider's JS player
 *      requests at runtime.
 *   3. [LookMovieWebExtractor] (FALLBACK) — runs the exact Kodi-addon flow
 *      (search -> play page -> storage object -> security API -> .m3u8)
 *      inside an off-screen WebView so the Cloudflare JS challenge is solved
 *      automatically and the `cf_clearance` cookie is carried into the
 *      security-API `fetch()`. This mirrors the way the LookMovie Kodi addon
 *      works.
 *   4. [StreamExtractor] (LAST RESORT) — the original OkHttp-based LookMovie
 *      extractor. Kept as a final fallback; it returns a direct HLS URL when
 *      LookMovie is reachable without a Cloudflare challenge.
 *
 * Whenever any stage hits a human-verification challenge (captcha /
 * Cloudflare interstitial), it is forwarded to the user in-app via
 * [VerificationActivity]. The user solves it in a real WebView, the resulting
 * cookies are injected back into the extractors, and extraction is retried.
 *
 * Before the stream is resolved (and until ExoPlayer reports STATE_READY),
 * the TMDB poster/backdrop is shown as a thumbnail via Coil so the user sees
 * the artwork while the stream is being found.
 *
 * The captured URL is always played with [ExoPlayer] — never in a WebView.

        //    .m3u8/.mp4 in ONE HTTP call. For a subset of popular MOVIES
        //    (Avatar, Spider-Man NWH, Top Gun Maverick…) this is a live,
        //    verified URL → playback in ~0.5 s. That is why "movies play very
        //    fast". But for most titles it returns a dead source (a 404-as-`.`
        //    HLS body, or a hellstorm.lol mp4 that 403s an OkHttp client), so
        //    VidStorm alone yields nothing.
        //  - VidSrc (vidsrc.me → cloudorchestranova RCP/PRORCP) resolves
        //    almost EVERYTHING — including all the movies VidStorm misses AND
        //    every TV episode — to a live #EXTM3U, in ~2.4 s over plain
        //    OkHttp. No WebView, no JS challenge.
        //
        // Previously these ran strictly sequentially: Stage 0 VidStorm first,
        // and only if it *errored* did we run Stage 1 VidSrc. Two problems:
        //   1. VidStorm's dead-source detection (esp. the hellstorm playlist
        //      path used by TV) added ~0.7 s of pure overhead before VidSrc
        //      could even start — so TV took ~3.1 s while fast movies took
        //      ~0.5 s. "Shows play super slow vs movies."
        //   2. The old verifyUrl() treated a 403 hellstorm mp4 as "works",
        //      so for TV VidStorm returned a DEAD url as the stream, ExoPlayer
        //      choked on the HTML "ACCESS DENIED" body, and VidSrc was NEVER
        //      reached → "shows wouldn't play at all" (now fixed in
        //      VidStormExtractor.verifyUrl).
        //
        // Racing them in parallel fixes both: whichever resolves first wins.
        // A fast-movie VidStorm hit still wins in ~0.5 s (unchanged), while TV
        // now resolves via VidSrc in ~2.4 s *without* waiting on VidStorm's
