/**
 * PlayerActivity — the on-device video player.
 *
 * This is the single activity that actually plays videos. It owns a fully
 * on-device extraction pipeline (no backend server, NO WebView at all):
 *
 * EVERY direct extractor is fired SIMULTANEOUSLY in a single all-servers
 * parallel race. Each extractor resolves a direct `.m3u8`/`.mp4` URL for the
 * given TMDB id over plain HTTP — no WebView, no embed scraping, no JS
 * challenge. The race collects ALL non-null results, ranks them English-first
 * then by provider reliability, plays the best, and queues the rest as
 * instant-failover candidates. When ExoPlayer rejects the head URL (the "acts
 * like it works then won't play" bug) the next queued candidate is popped
 * with zero re-extraction. Only when the whole queue is exhausted is the
 * race re-run once more as a last attempt.
 *
 * The available direct extractors include (all pure HTTP): VidStorm, VidSrc,
 * VidSrcMe, VidSrcPro, VidSrcNet, VidLink, VixSrc, NoTorrent (Stremio),
 * MeowTV, Videasy (10 servers), KissKH, VidSync, LordFlix (10 servers),
 * DahmerMovies, TwoEmbed (+ sub-streams), SuperEmbed.
 *
 * Before the stream is resolved (and until ExoPlayer reports STATE_READY),
 * the TMDB poster/backdrop is shown as a thumbnail via Coil so the user sees
 * the artwork while the stream is being found.
 *
 * The captured URL is always played with [ExoPlayer] — never in a WebView.
